# E07a-Particles
Playing with particles and emitters

In this project, I used my understanding of particles to create a smoke blob that dissapates just like the behavior of smoke (this is done using decay). Click to make smoke appear and watch as it dissipates!

By inputting low x and y velocity values, the smoke moves slowly just like it would if it were to rise in real life.
